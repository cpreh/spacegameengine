The sge universe

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This site exists to give you an overview of all the libraries and projects
related to the graphics engine <em>sge</em> and also to give you some pointers
on where to look if you want to get involved.
</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>
After meditating over Stroustrup's great tome &quot;The C++ programming
language&quot; for over 9000 years, <strong>Freundlich</strong> started a one-man C++ project to
develop some sort of &quot;space game&quot;. Initially using Windows and
DirectX, he quickly hacked together something useful, but in a one-man project,
it's hard to keep motivating yourself.
</p>
<p>
So about a year after its inception, <strong>Phillemann</strong> joined sge and
the project developed more quickly. Some time later, they both agreed to work
on a game called <em>sanguis</em> together. This time, however, it wasn't
supposed to be a space game. It was supposed to be a down shooter in the style
of <a href="http://www.crimsonland.com/">Crimsonland</a> or <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/violetland/">violetland</a>. This is when
<strong>nille</strong> joined the team as a graphics and sound artist.
<p>
<strong><u>Insert image of sanguis here</u></strong>
</p>
During the development of sanguis, it became apparent that sge was too
monolithic. A lot of the functions and concepts were too general to be in a
graphics engine. For example, sge had a logging facility, a math library and so
forth. So a decision was made to move the general stuff to a new library,
<em>fcppt</em>. Later on, a few other libraries were spawned, like <em>awl</em>
and <em>mizuiro</em>.

Developers

<p>
Philipp Reh a.k.a. <a href="https://github.com/freundlich">Freundlich</a> (founder and main developer)
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/Phillemann">Phillemann</a> (main developer)
</p>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>
There are a lot of graphics engines out there. Most prominently, there are <a
href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/">irrlicht</a> and <a
href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">ogre</a>. But those aren't the only ones. So, should
I choose sge over those two? The answer is: it depends.
</p>
<p>
The problem with virtually <em>all</em> of the open source graphics engines is
that <em>they don't use proper, modern C++</em>. Yeah, they use classes and
shit, but is the code exception-safe and memory-leak-free? Are the external
libraries properly sealed off from the user via a clean, well-though interface? Or
does it use singletons to make your life hard and mask dependencies between
the subsystems, put everything into one big namespace and has needlessly huge
base classes?
</p>
<p>
So sge tries to be distinct by being as clean, memory-leak-free,
exception-safe, singleton-less and portable as possible. That, however, comes
with a price: 
<ul>
<li>
sge ist <em>very</em> actively developed, which means that you have to be
prepared for sudden changes in the API. We as developers are, of course, eager
to explain why the changes were made and how you can adapt your code.
</li>
<li>
sge can &mdash; in its current state &mdash; more be thought of as a
<em>low-level</em> library. For example, it has a very clean, abstract renderer
interface and a good abstraction for vertex buffers, but it lacks the concept
of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph">scene graph</a> and all
the advantages this brings. In this case, it's because implementing a scene
graph &quot;The Right Way&quot; and being as abstract as possible is
<em>extremely</em> difficult.
</li>
<li>
sge tries to implement everything as clean as possible, but it also does most
things <em>on demand</em>. So if you're missing something in sge, we might not
have needed it yet (in sanguis, for example).
</li>
<li>
There is <em>no documentation</em> available. This is also due to the volatile
nature of the project. There are only two people working on it, so writing
documentation for an interface that might change in the near future is pretty
much useless. <em>But</em>: We have an IRC channel producing page-long logs
each day and we love to talk about sge and its sister projects, so we're happy
to answer all your questions.  Also, we have at least one stand-alone example
for every subsystem in sge, with code that's well-written and partially
documented (we're working on the documentation, though).
</li>
</ul>
So in summation, if you want to be as productive as possible with your project,
you will most likely be happier with the larger engine projects. But then, you
have to use their crappy interfaces.
<h3>What does sge offer?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
A complete <strong>renderer interface</strong> with backends for
<strong>DirectX</strong> (in development) and <strong>OpenGL</strong>
(considered mature). There's a really nice (modern C++y) abstraction layer over
<strong>vertex buffers</strong>. There is, however, <strong>no shader
abstraction</strong> if you want to be independent of HLSL or GLSL.
</li>
<li>
A very abstract, yet optimized <strong>sprite system</strong> supporting
<strong>point sprites</strong>.
</li>
<li>
The ability load <strong>truetype fonts</strong> (via <a
href="http://www.freetype.org/">freetype</a> plugin) and <strong>bitmap
fonts</strong> with an interface which is agnostic as to what specific type of
font you're using.
</li>
<li>
An <strong>audio subsystem</strong> supporting streaming sounds (for background
music) and nonstreaming sounds. With loaders for <strong>wave</strong> and
<strong>Ogg/Vorbis</strong> and with an <strong>OpenAL</strong> player backend.
</li>
<li>
Abstractions for <strong>timers</strong>
</li>
<li>
Insert other stuff here

</ul>
