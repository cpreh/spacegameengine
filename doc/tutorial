\section{Introduction}
This tutorial shall provide an introduction to \emph{spacegameengine} that enables you to actually program with it.
\emph{spacegameengine} has been designed to layer on different levels.
That means it doesn't want to take any functionality away from you if it is possible.
On the other hand \emph{spacegameengine} doesn't use any API directly so the only restrictions it has arise from that.

\section{A Basic Program}
\emph{spacegameengine's} heart is the so called \emph{plugin\_manager}. It handles plugin creation and obtaining interfaces from them.
The very basic thing we probably need is a \emph{renderer} interface so we can render something.
\emph{renderer} cannot be obtained directly. First you need to create a \emph{renderer\_system} which is a class representing a renderer plugin.
Why does \emph{spacegameengine} discriminate those interfaces?
First it is because APIs like Direct3D can create multiple interfaces.
Second you sometimes need to obtain information about available renderer, resolutions and other capabilities.
Let's create a \emph{renderer\_system} and a \emph{renderer}.

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <iostream>
#include <exception>

#include <sge/plugin_manager.hpp>
#include <sge/renderer/renderer_system.hpp>
#include <sge/renderer/renderer.hpp>
#include <sge/renderer/types.hpp>

int main()
try
{
  sge::plugin_manager manager;
  sge::renderer_system_ptr rs = 
      manager.get_plugin<sge::renderer_system>();
  const sge::renderer_parameters param(
      sge::display_mode(1024,768,sge::BD_32)
		                      );
  sge::renderer_ptr rend = rs->create_renderer(param);
}
catch(const std::exception& e)
{
  std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';
  return 1;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Note that we don't free anything. The engine's basic design concept is to use RAII everywhere.
You will never need to free anything explicitly.
All the so called \emph{"T\_ptr"} are \emph{sge::shared\_ptr$<$T$>$}. That means you can copy them.

\section{We need input}
The next thing we will do is to let the program run in a loop until the user presses any key.
\emph{spacegameengines's} \emph{input\_system} uses a callback system so multiple classes can receive the same information.
First we need to load an input plugin.

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <boost/lambda/lambda.hpp>
#include <boost/signals/connection.hpp>
#include <sge/input/input_system.hpp>

/* snip */
  sge::input_system_ptr is =
      manager.get_plugin<sge::input_system>(
          rend->get_window());
  
  bool running = true;

  boost::signals::scoped_connection con(
     is->register_callback(
         boost::lambda::var(running)
         = false)
  );

  while(running)
  {
    is->dispatch();
  }
\end{lstlisting}

The input plugin needs the window which the renderer created internally.
\emph{input\_system::register\_callback} returns a \emph{boost::signals::connection}.
That means you have to track that connection.
We use \emph{boost::signals::scoped\_connection} for that purpose.
\emph{input\_system::dispatch} must be called each frame to process the new input.

\section{Rendering something}
\emph{spacegameengine} supports rendering using a
\emph{vertex\_buffer} and an optional \emph{index\_buffer}.
These two classes are the lowest layers the engine provides that allow you to specify geometry.
The functions \emph{vertex\_buffer::data} and \emph{index\_buffer::data} are by far the most low level functions to do so.
Setting indices through a raw pointer often is acceptable but for vertices it is not as vertices are more complex data structures that depend on a variety of settings.
Making it easier for the user, \emph{spacegameengine} provides a wrapper around a \emph{vertex} and \emph{vertex\_formats} which is called \emph{vertex\_pointer}.
It is accessible through \emph{vertex\_buffer's} iterator interface. Of course \emph{index\_buffer} has an interator interface too.
Now we want to draw a rectangle using two triangles with colors.

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <sge/renderer/vertex_buffer.hpp>
#include <sge/renderer/index_buffer.hpp>
#include <sge/renderer/vertex_format.hpp>
#include <sge/renderer/lock_ptr.hpp>
#include <sge/renderer/color.hpp>

/* snip */
  sge::vertex_buffer_ptr vb =
      rend->create_vertex_buffer(
          sge::vertex_format().add(sge::VU_Pos)
                              .add(sge::VU_Diffuse),
          4);
  {
    sge::lock_ptr<sge::vertex_buffer_ptr> _lock(vb);
    sge::vertex_buffer::iterator it = vb->begin();

    // top left
    it->pos() = sge::pos3(-1,1,0);
    it->diffuse() = sge::colors::red;
    ++it;

    // top right
    it->pos() = sge::pos3(1,1,0);
    it->diffuse() = sge::colors::blue;
    ++it;

    // bottom left
    it->pos() = sge::pos3(-1,-1,0);
    it->diffuse() = sge::colors::yellow;
    ++it;

    // bottom right
    it->pos() = sge::pos3(1,-1,0);
    it->diffuse() = sge::colors::green;
  }

  const sge::index_buffer::value_type indices[] =
    { 0, 1, 2,
      1, 2, 3 };

  sge::index_buffer_ptr ib =
    rend->create_index_buffer(
      6, sge::RF_Default, indices);

  while(running)
  {
    is->dispatch();

    rend->begin_rendering();
    rend->render(vb, ib, 0, vb->size(),
                 sge::PT_Triangle, 2);
    rend->end_rendering();
  }

\end{lstlisting}

First of all we create a \emph{vertex\_buffer}.
The first parameter specifies the \emph{vertex\_format} we are using.
The second parameter is the number of vertices that shall fit in the buffer.
There are two further parameters that are optional: The resource type and an initial source pointer.
We don't use an initial source\_pointer (but we could have done so).
The \emph{vertex\_buffer's} data is initialized "on the fly".
We use \emph{lock\_ptr} to lock the \emph{vertex\_buffer's} content and use an iterator to set all the vertices.

Next we create an \emph{index\_buffer} and initialize it directly.

To draw anything we need to be in a block enclosed by \emph{renderer::begin\_rendering} and \emph{renderer::end\_rendering}.
\emph{renderer::render} is declared as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
void renderer::render(vertex_buffer_ptr vb,
                     index_buffer_ptr ib,
		     unsigned first_vertex,
		     unsigned num_vertices,
		     primitive_type ptype,
		     unsigned primitive_count,
		     unsigned first_index = 0);
\end{lstlisting}

\emph{first\_vertex} and \emph{num\_vertices} specify a "lock range" in the \emph{vertex\_buffer} that is used.
Hence we use \emph{ 0, 4} which means "starting at the 0th vertex in the \emph{vertex\_buffer} and using four vertices which is the \emph{vertex\_buffer's} size from there on".
\emph{primitve\_count} is the number of primitives to draw. In our case it is two triangles.
The optional parameter \emph{first\_index} is the first index in the \emph{index\_buffer}.
Actually opengl doesn't care about \emph{first\_vertex} and \emph{num\_vertices} when rendering with an \emph{index\_buffer} but Direct3D does.
Those paramters are always needed when rendering a non indexed format such as a triangle fan.
If you specify a non indexed format the parameters \emph{ib} and \emph{first\_index} are ignored.
